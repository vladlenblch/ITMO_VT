# VLIW-IV Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Documentation

The VLIW ISA is a simple register-based instruction set inspired by VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) principles and RISC-V. This documentation provides an overview of the instructions available in the VLIW ISA, their syntax, and their semantics.

## Architecture Overview

The VLIW architecture is a 32-bit VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architecture inspired by RISC-V and classic VLIW designs. It features:

- 32 general-purpose registers (including one hardwired zero register — writes to `Zero` are silently ignored)
- Fixed-length 14-byte (112-bit) instruction bundles, divided into 4 slots for parallel execution
- Load-store architecture (memory access only through specific instructions in dedicated slots)
- Simple addressing modes
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Support for function calls and returns through jump-and-link instructions
- Arithmetic, logical, and control flow operations executed in parallel where possible
- Static scheduling: The compiler/assembler bundles independent operations; hardware executes them in lockstep

This architecture emphasizes instruction-level parallelism (ILP) through wide instructions, making it ideal for educational exploration of VLIW concepts like compiler scheduling, slot utilization, and parallelism trade-offs, while maintaining RISC-like simplicity in individual operations.

Comments in VLIW assembly code are denoted by the `;` character.

Inspired by [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf) and classic VLIW designs.

## Immediate Value Relocation Directives

The VLIW assembly language provides special directives for handling larger immediate values that don't fit within the standard instruction formats similar to RISC-IV implementation:

- **%hi(symbol)**
    - **Description:** Used to extract the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit address or immediate value
    - **Usage:** `lui rd, %hi(symbol) / nop / nop / nop`
    - **Operation:** `rd <- (symbol & 0xFFFFF000)`

- **%lo(symbol)**
    - **Description:** Used to extract the lower 12 bits of a 32-bit address or immediate value
    - **Usage:** `addi rd, rs, %lo(symbol) / nop / nop / nop`
    - **Operation:** `rd <- rs + (symbol & 0x00000FFF)`

These directives are typically used together to load a full 32-bit address into a register:

```assembly
lui  a0, %hi(address)     / nop / nop / nop ; Load upper 20 bits into a0
addi a0, a0, %lo(address) / nop / nop / nop ; Add lower 12 bits to a0
```

## Instructions

Instruction size: 14 bytes (112-bit bundle).

```text
Bundle: [ALU1:32] [ALU2:32] [MEM:24] [CTRL:24]

[ALU1/ALU2]:
  [opcode:5] [rd:5] [rs1:5] [rs2:5] [reserved:12]   ; add sub mul mulh div rem sll srl sra and or xor
  [opcode:5] [rd:5] [rs1:5] [imm_sign:17]           ; addi slti
  [opcode:5] [rd:5] [imm_unsign:22]                 ; lui
  [opcode:5] [rd:5] [rs1:5] [reserved:17]           ; mv
  [opcode:5] [reserved:27]                          ; nop
[MEM] (24 bits):
  [opcode:3] [rd:5]  [base:5] [offset_sign:11]      ; lw lb        (reg = rd)
  [opcode:3] [rs2:5] [base:5] [offset_sign:11]      ; sw sb        (reg = rs2)
  [opcode:3] [reserved:21]                          ; nop
[CTRL] (24 bits):
  [opcode:4] [rs1:5] [rs2:5] [offset_sign:10]       ; beq bne blt bgt ble bgtu bleu
  [opcode:4] [rs1:5] [offset_sign:15]               ; beqz bnez
  [opcode:4] [rd:5]  [offset_sign:15]               ; jal
  [opcode:4] [rs:5]  [reserved:15]                  ; jr
  [opcode:4] [offset_sign:20]                       ; j
  [opcode:4] [reserved:20]                          ; nop halt
```

The two ALU slots are 32 bits each; MEM and CTRL are 24 bits each, for a 112-bit (14-byte)
bundle. The opcode occupies the high bits of its slot, sized to the number of operations the slot
defines: 5 bits for ALU (17 ops), 4 for CTRL (14 ops), 3 for MEM (5 ops). Register fields
follow the opcode; the remaining low bits hold the immediate/offset.

Every immediate and offset is **silently truncated** to its field width: the value is reduced
to the low bits of the field and sign-extended (`lui`'s `imm_unsign` is zero-extended), with no
error if it does not fit. So `addi`/`slti` see a 17-bit signed immediate, branches a 10-bit
signed offset, `beqz`/`bnez`/`jal` a 15-bit one, `j` a 20-bit one, and memory ops an 11-bit
one. `lui` keeps only the low 20 bits (after the `<< 12` shift the upper bits of the 22-bit
field cannot be represented in a 32-bit word). The `%lo` (12-bit) and `%hi` (20-bit) relocation
values fit within these fields unchanged.

Each instruction is a bundle with 4 slots: Slot 0 (ALU1), Slot 1 (ALU2), Slot 2 (Memory), Slot 3 (Control). Operations in slots execute in parallel. Unused slots are NOP (no operation). Assembly syntax uses `/` to separate slots.

**Execution model:** All source operands are read first, then all results are written back simultaneously. The order of register writes from ALU1, ALU2, and Memory slots is non-deterministic — if multiple slots write to the same register, the result is undefined. The control slot always executes last. The compiler/assembler must ensure that parallel operations in the same bundle are independent (no write-write or read-write conflicts across slots).

add rd, rs1, rs2 / addi rd, rs1, k / lw rd, offset(rs1) / beq rs1, rs2, k

## ISA Specific State Views

- `<reg>:dec`, `<reg>:hex` -- View the value of a specific register in decimal or hexadecimal format.

Available registers: `Zero`, `Ra`, `Sp`, `Gp`, `Tp`, `T0`, `T1`, `T2`, `S0Fp`, `S1`, `A0`, `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, `A4`, `A5`, `A6`, `A7`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`, `S5`, `S6`, `S7`, `S8`, `S9`, `S10`, `S11`, `T3`, `T4`, `T5`, `T6`.

### Slot utilization (parallelism)

Each VLIW bundle has four execution slots (memory, ALU1, ALU2, control). A slot containing the corresponding `nop` is idle; everything else counts as active. The simulator tallies how many slots each executed bundle used and exposes three summary view variables. They're typically used with `slice: last` because the values are run-totals.

- `vliw:load-percent` -- average slot utilization across the run, as an integer percent. `(active_slots * 100) / (bundles * 4)`. `25%` means each bundle used one slot on average; `100%` means every slot of every bundle was active.
- `vliw:avg-load` -- average number of active processing units (slots) per executed bundle, rendered with two decimals. `active_slots / bundles`, a value in `0.00`–`4.00`. This is the same measure as `vliw:load-percent` expressed as units-per-bundle instead of a percent of the four-wide width.
- `vliw:bundles-by-load` -- histogram rendered as comma-separated `K:N (P%)` entries, one per non-empty bucket. `K` is the active-slot count, `N` is the number of bundles in that bucket, `P` is its percent share of all executed bundles. Empty buckets are skipped. A peak at 1 means a serial program; a peak at 3-4 means the compiler / programmer is exploiting the pipeline.

Example -- print a load summary at the end of the simulation:

```yaml
reports:
    - name: vliw-load
      slice: last
      view: |
        vliw:load-percent:    {vliw:load-percent}
        vliw:avg-load:        {vliw:avg-load}
        vliw:bundles-by-load: {vliw:bundles-by-load}
```

For `hello.s` running on this ISA the summary reads:

```text
vliw:load-percent:    81%
vliw:avg-load:        3.24
vliw:bundles-by-load: 1:3 (9%), 3:16 (48%), 4:14 (42%)
```

— 14 fully-packed bundles (`4:14 (42%)`), 16 three-wide (`3:16 (48%)`), 3 with a single active slot (`1:3 (9%)`), no idle or two-slot bundles, for an average of `3.24` active units per bundle.

All three lines are also emitted together by the generic `{isa-specific}` summary block, which lets a single report template stay uniform across ISAs.
